Most of the metadata recorded was the same for each file. This is because my tract is only 4 pages long so there is no change in authorship, topic, chapter, etc. throughout. I mostly recorded data which would help someone locate the object (author, title, digital location). I did choose to also include some details about the word count and the physical condition of the book so someone could get a better sense of the object without looking directly at it themself.
