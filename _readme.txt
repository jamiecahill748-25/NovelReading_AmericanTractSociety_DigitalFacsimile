Most of the metadata recorded was the same for each file. This is because my tract is only 4 pages long so there is no change in authorship, topic, chapter, etc. throughout. I mostly recorded data which would help someone locate the object (author, title, digital location). I did choose to also include some details about the word count and the physical condition of the book so someone could get a better sense of the object without looking directly at it themself.




Going into the text extraction process I was expecting very few errors as the print is extremely clear. I used Adobe Acrobat to do this, and there were more errors than I initially expected. Some of the errors had obvious causes such as a blemish on the page making the software turn a period into a semicolon. There were, however, more puzzling errors as well such as adding a period when there is no visible mark on the page indicating one. There were typically 2-5 errors per page. Many of the errors had to do with spacing or confusing similar looking letters such as turning an "o" into an "e".
